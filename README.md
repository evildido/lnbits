### Running LNbits

See the [install guide](docs/guide/installation.md) for details on installation and setup.

There's a [slightly different setup](docs/devs/installation.md) if you want to contribute to LNbits, but if your changes don't require adding or removing any package dependencies you don't have to bother with that, just follow the [normal installation](docs/guide/installation.md) steps.

### Credits
LNbits is inspired by all the great work of [opennode.com](https://www.opennode.com/), and in particular [lnpay.co](https://lnpay.co/). Both work as excellent funding sources for LNbits.
